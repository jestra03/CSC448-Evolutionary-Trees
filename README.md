# Evolutionary Trees Lab

### Your goal is to try to reconstruct the phylogenic tree given orthologous proteins sampled from bacteria.

* The sequences are in the data/ folder
* Do get the BLOSUM substitution matrix (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/blosum)
* Choose and implement an algorithm from the ones discussed in class
* Evaluate your tree
* Thinks how to compare your tree to that of your classmates and potetntially construct a consensus tree
